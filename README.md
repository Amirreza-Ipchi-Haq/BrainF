(I can't say the full name of this language. You can search google for its full name)
# BrainF
This is an interpreter for a joke esoteric programming language called BrainF (Google this language for more information). The good feature about this interpreter is that it doesn't need to be installed and can be used portable. Also, it's very simple and lightweight.
##How to use
To run a "Hello World" example, create a file with the following text:

```+[-->-[>>+>-----<<]<--<---]>-.>>>+.>>..+++[.>]<<<<.+++.------.<<-.>>>>+.```

Save the text and run it (Windows users can run this using the interpreter, just like any program. UNIX-based need to allow execution of this program, then can run the Linux executable in a terminal by typing `<ProgramLocation>/BrainF_Linux <CodeLocation><CodeName>` (If the terminal is open where the program is, just put a `./` behinf `BrainF_Linux`)).

To run this in any directory, you have to add this to your global variables. You can search how to do it in each operating system.
