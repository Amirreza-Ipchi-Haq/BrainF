# BrainF
This is an interpreter written in C for a joke esoteric programming language called BrainF (Google this language for more information). The good feature about this interpreter is that it doesn't need to be installed and it's portable. Also, it's very simple and lightweight.
## How to get
You can open releases or click [here](https://github.com/Amirreza-Ipchi-Haq/BrainF/releases) to get the pre-compiled executables, or you can compile the code yourself using a gcc compiler.
## How to use
To run a "Hello World" example, create a file with the following text:
```
+[-->-[>>+>-----<<]<--<---]>-.>>>+.>>..+++[.>]<<<<.+++.------.<<-.>>>>+.[,]
```
Save the text and run it (Windows users can run this using the interpreter, just like any program). GNU+Linux users need to allow the execution of this program (You can google how to do this), then they can run the GNU+Linux executable in a terminal by typing `<ProgramLocation>/BrainF_Linux <CodeLocation><CodeName>` (If the terminal is open where the program is, just put a `./` behind `BrainF_POSIX`)).

To run this in any directory, you have to add this to your global variables. You can search how to do it in each operating system.

This library has arguments. To see all of them, give the argument `--help` to the program.
## Sidenotes
This program uses the [strcal](https://github.com/Amirreza-Ipchi-Haq/strcal) library for some string operations. The download link has been provided.
